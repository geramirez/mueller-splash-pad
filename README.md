# Mueller Splashpad

Is the splash pad open? I built this crowdsourcing site to answer that question. 
[https://www.muellersplashpad.com/](www.muellersplashpad.com)

How it works:

The status is updated when people vote on whether the park is working or not. Votes are active for 1 hour and people that are within .2km of the park get 2 votes (because they can presumably see if it’s on or not). 

Ideally this would linked to the physical switch, but this might work for now. Reach out if you’re interested in other features or helping.
